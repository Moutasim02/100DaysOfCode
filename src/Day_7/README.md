# Hackerrank Questions
Today I solved three hackerrank questions from java introduction section, might make a repo later to solve random questions from each section after the 100DaysOfCode

### What I learned today:

- We can get size value of primitive datatype by using the built-in Class name and call Max_Value or Min_Value
  - Example: Byte.MIN_VALUE
- Static keyword importance: I usually used it a lot but mostly with no real understanding of the main concept behind it:
  - Note: You can't call global variable from static method like main...
    - So you have to assign the global variable as static
      - Why? Because we don't want to always make an instance object of the class to access the variable/method
- Also, I learned that you can make a static block only, Nice:)
