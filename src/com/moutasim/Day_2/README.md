# Recursion
- Recursion is a technique of making a method call itself.
- I learned it by experimenting...
- It must have a condition to stop the method from calling itself.
- It seems to be a big topic and will look into it later

## To-Do for tomorrow

- Add two matrices...
- Binary search possibly

From now on, everyday I will post what shall I do for tomorrow to keep in track, but it's most likely to be with side projects
